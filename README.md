Task 3: Linear Regression
Objective: Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression.
Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Linear Regression is a supervised learning technique which predicts a value based on its inputs.

After preprocessing and Standardizing the data, I used the following steps:-
1. Split the data into 60% training data abd 40% test data.
2. Imported LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model and then trained it on only the age column. This is simple Linear Regression.
3. Predicted values on the test data and calculated performaces (MAE, R^2,MSE).
4. Next was to train on all columns. This is multiple Linear Regression.
5. Predicted values on the test data and calculated performaces (MAE, R^2,MSE).
6. Observed the regression line and their weights (coefficients).
